# Smart Home using Arduino

This prject is a simple IOT based smart home system built using Arduino.
It detects motion ,measures light intensity ,and monitors temperature using basic sensors.


## hardware 🧰used
-Arduino uno
-IR sensor
-LDR sensor
-DHT sensor
-LED
-Jumper wires
-Breadboard

## 🏠 features
-motion/entry detection using IR sensor
-light sensing using LDR
-tempeature monitoring using DHT
-Basic automation logic
 (LED turns ON when motion is detected and when temperaure goes high)
-serial monitoring of sensor data

## 📁code
the code is available in main.ino.
